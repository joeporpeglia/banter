# `@banter/client`

TypeScript React Client for Banter.

## Notes:

- Communicates with `@banter/server` over a [`socket.io`](https://socket.io/) connect. Types for the API schema are defined in `@banter/game`.
- Uses [`chakra`](https://chakra-ui.com/) for core UI components. Haven't done any theme shit but `chakra` supports it.
- Uses the `react-scripts` toolchain from [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
